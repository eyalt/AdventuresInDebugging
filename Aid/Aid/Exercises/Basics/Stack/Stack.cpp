But displaying opcodes is only doing half the job.
When your code crashes on you, it's not enough to look at where you are right now - 
you should also figure out where you came from. That, my friends, is stack analysis.

"Stack analysis" is my fancy way of saying you should look at the call stack
and figure out the chain of calls that led you to this place.

You should also remember that the call stack holds addresses to which each
function *returns* (remember how the 'call' opcode works?)

Let's do some of that now.
Begin by telling me the return address of this very function.
That's the 'k' command and its variations for you.
